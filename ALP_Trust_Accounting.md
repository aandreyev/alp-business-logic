# ALP Trust Accounting System
## Comprehensive Guide to Client Fund Management & Compliance

### Overview & Purpose

The ALP trust accounting system manages client funds with strict regulatory compliance for legal practice requirements. Trust accounts are segregated client money accounts that lawyers hold on behalf of clients, with rigorous reporting, reconciliation, and audit trail requirements mandated by legal practice boards.

**Key Compliance Features:**
- **Segregated Client Funds**: Client money separate from firm operating accounts
- **Transaction Tracking**: Complete audit trail for all fund movements
- **Reconciliation Management**: Regular bank reconciliation with variance tracking
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated compliance reports for legal practice boards
- **Matter-Based Allocation**: Client fund tracking by specific legal matters
- **Overdraft Prevention**: System controls to prevent client fund misuse

## Database Schema

### üìä **Core Tables**

```sql
-- Trust account setup and configuration
trust_accounts (
    id, name, account_number, bank_name, bsb,
    opening_balance, current_balance, 
    account_type, is_active,
    office_id, inserted_at, updated_at, is_deleted
)

-- Individual transaction records
trust_transactions (
    id, trust_account_id, matter_id, client_id,
    transaction_type, amount, description, reference,
    transaction_date, processed_date,
    -- Reconciliation tracking
    bank_statement_id, reconciled, reconciliation_date,
    -- Approval workflow
    requires_approval, approved_by_id, approved_at,
    inserted_at, updated_at, inserted_by_id, is_deleted
)

-- Double-entry bookkeeping records
trust_ledger_entries (
    id, trust_transaction_id, account_code, 
    debit_amount, credit_amount, description,
    inserted_at, updated_at, is_deleted
)

-- Bank statement reconciliation
trust_bank_statements (
    id, trust_account_id, statement_date, 
    opening_balance, closing_balance, 
    statement_reference, uploaded_by_id,
    reconciled, reconciliation_date,

```

### üîó **Key Relationships**

```sql
-- Matter and client relationships
trust_transactions.matter_id ‚Üí matters.id
trust_transactions.client_id ‚Üí clients.id

-- Account relationships
trust_transactions.trust_account_id ‚Üí trust_accounts.id
trust_ledger_entries.trust_transaction_id ‚Üí trust_transactions.id

-- User relationships (approval and processing)
trust_transactions.approved_by_id ‚Üí users.id
trust_transactions.inserted_by_id ‚Üí users.id
```

## Transaction Types & Business Logic

### üìä **Transaction Type Enum Mapping**

```sql
CASE 
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 1 THEN 'Deposit'
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 2 THEN 'Withdrawal'
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 3 THEN 'TransferOut'
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 4 THEN 'TransferIn'
END as transaction_type_description
```

### üí∞ **Transaction Types Explained**

#### **1. Deposit (Type 1)**
- **Purpose**: Client funds received into trust account
- **Examples**: Settlement funds, retainer payments, client deposits
- **Effect**: Increases trust account balance
- **Compliance**: Must be client money only, not firm funds

#### **2. Withdrawal (Type 2)**
- **Purpose**: Client funds disbursed from trust account
- **Examples**: Settlement payments, expense reimbursements, client refunds
- **Effect**: Decreases trust account balance
- **Compliance**: Requires client authorization and matter justification

#### **3. TransferOut (Type 3)**
- **Purpose**: Funds moved from this trust account to another account
- **Examples**: Inter-office transfers, bank account changes
- **Effect**: Decreases source trust account balance
- **Compliance**: Detailed documentation required for audit trail

#### **4. TransferIn (Type 4)**
- **Purpose**: Funds received from another trust account
- **Examples**: Office transfers, account consolidations
- **Effect**: Increases destination trust account balance
- **Compliance**: Must match corresponding TransferOut transaction

## Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

### üìã **Audit Trail Requirements**

Every trust transaction must maintain complete audit trail:

```sql
-- Comprehensive trust transaction audit
SELECT 
  tt.id as transaction_id,
  tt.transaction_date,
  ta.name as trust_account_name,
  ta.account_number,
  CASE 
    WHEN tt.transaction_type = 1 THEN 'Deposit'
    WHEN tt.transaction_type = 2 THEN 'Withdrawal'
    WHEN tt.transaction_type = 3 THEN 'TransferOut'
    WHEN tt.transaction_type = 4 THEN 'TransferIn'
  END as transaction_type,
  tt.amount,
  tt.description,
  tt.reference,
  m.name as matter_name,
  c.name as client_name,
  creator.first_name || ' ' || creator.last_name as created_by,
  CASE WHEN tt.approved_by_id IS NOT NULL THEN
    approver.first_name || ' ' || approver.last_name
  ELSE 'Pending Approval'
  END as approved_by,
  tt.reconciled,
  tt.reconciliation_date
FROM trust_transactions tt
JOIN trust_accounts ta ON tt.trust_account_id = ta.id
LEFT JOIN matters m ON tt.matter_id = m.id
LEFT JOIN clients c ON tt.client_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN users creator ON tt.inserted_by_id = creator.id
LEFT JOIN users approver ON tt.approved_by_id = approver.id
WHERE tt.is_deleted = false
  AND ta.is_deleted = false
ORDER BY tt.transaction_date DESC, tt.id DESC;
```

### üîç **Balance Reconciliation**

```sql
-- Trust account balance verification
WITH account_balances AS (
  SELECT 
    ta.id as account_id,
    ta.name as account_name,
    ta.account_number,
    ta.opening_balance,
    -- Calculate current balance from transactions
    ta.opening_balance + 
    COALESCE(SUM(
      CASE 
        WHEN tt.transaction_type IN (1,4) THEN tt.amount  -- Deposits and TransferIn
        WHEN tt.transaction_type IN (2,3) THEN -tt.amount -- Withdrawals and TransferOut
        ELSE 0
      END
    ), 0) as calculated_balance,
    ta.current_balance as stored_balance,
    COUNT(tt.id) as transaction_count,
    MAX(tt.transaction_date) as last_transaction_date
  FROM trust_accounts ta
  LEFT JOIN trust_transactions tt ON ta.id = tt.trust_account_id

  calculated_balance,
  stored_balance,
  calculated_balance - stored_balance as variance,
  transaction_count,
  last_transaction_date,
  CASE 
    WHEN ABS(calculated_balance - stored_balance) < 0.01 THEN 'Balanced'
    ELSE 'VARIANCE DETECTED'
  END as balance_status
FROM account_balances
ORDER BY ABS(calculated_balance - stored_balance) DESC;
```

### üìä **Client Fund Tracking**

```sql
-- Client-specific fund balances by matter
WITH client_fund_positions AS (
  SELECT 
    c.id as client_id,
    c.name as client_name,

        WHEN tt.transaction_type IN (2,3) THEN -tt.amount -- Funds out
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) as client_balance,
    COUNT(tt.id) as transaction_count,
    MIN(tt.transaction_date) as first_transaction,
    MAX(tt.transaction_date) as last_transaction,
    -- Identify potential issues
    CASE 
      WHEN SUM(
        CASE 
          WHEN tt.transaction_type IN (1,4) THEN tt.amount

  END as transaction_type,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  SUM(tt.amount) as total_amount,
  AVG(tt.amount) as avg_transaction_amount,
  MIN(tt.amount) as min_amount,
  MAX(tt.amount) as max_amount
FROM trust_transactions tt

## Critical Enum Mappings

```sql
-- Transaction Types
CASE 
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 1 THEN 'Deposit'
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 2 THEN 'Withdrawal'
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 3 THEN 'TransferOut'
  WHEN tt.transaction_type = 4 THEN 'TransferIn'
END

-- Account Status
CASE 
  WHEN ta.is_active = true THEN 'Active'
  WHEN ta.is_active = false THEN 'Inactive'
END

-- Reconciliation Status
CASE 
  WHEN tt.reconciled = true THEN 'Reconciled'
  WHEN tt.reconciled = false THEN 'Unreconciled'
END

-- Approval Status
CASE 
  WHEN tt.requires_approval = false THEN 'No Approval Required'
  WHEN tt.requires_approval = true AND tt.approved_by_id IS NULL THEN 'Pending Approval'
  WHEN tt.requires_approval = true AND tt.approved_by_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Approved'
END
```

## Gotchas & Special Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Regulatory Compliance**

1. **Segregation Requirement**: Trust funds must never be mixed with firm operating funds
2. **Overdraft Prevention**: System must prevent negative client balances
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history required for compliance
4. **Approval Workflows**: Large transactions may require partner approval

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Integrity**

1. **Double Entry**: All transactions should create corresponding ledger entries
2. **Reconciliation Timing**: Regular reconciliation required (monthly minimum)
3. **Balance Calculations**: Always verify calculated vs stored balances
4. **Transaction Reversal**: Corrections require offsetting transactions, not deletions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Analytics Considerations**

1. **Reconciled vs Unreconciled**: Only include reconciled transactions in balance calculations
2. **Date Sensitivity**: Transaction date vs processed date may differ
3. **Client Privacy**: Trust reports may require client confidentiality protections
4. **Regulatory Changes**: Compliance requirements may change by jurisdiction
