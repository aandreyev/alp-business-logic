# ALP Analytics Context Summary
## How Business Modules Drive Analytics & Business Intelligence

### Overview

This document bridges the comprehensive ALP business application with the analytics framework, showing how each business module contributes valuable data for business intelligence and decision-making.

### Database Structure Insights

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Database Details for Analytics:**
- **Column naming**: All database columns use snake_case (e.g., `updated_at`, `is_deleted`, `client_id`)
- **Enum storage**: All enums stored as integers - use CASE statements for display values
- **Time entries**: Table-per-hierarchy inheritance with `discriminator` field
- **Rate precision**: Stored √ó10 (450 = $45.00/hour) - always divide by 10 for display
- **Time tracking**: Uses `units` field (6-minute increments) - divide by 10 for hours
- **Soft deletes**: Always filter `WHERE is_deleted = false`

**Key Enum Mappings:**
- Matter Status: 1=ToBeQuoted, 2=QuotedAwaitingAcceptance, 3=Lost, 4=Open, 5=Closed, 6=Finalised, 7=Deleted
- Billable Types: 1=Billable, 2=NonBillable, 3=NonChargeable, 4=ProBono
- Invoice Status: 1=Draft, 2=AwaitingApproval, 3=Approved, 4=Sent, 5=All
- Trust Transaction Types: 1=Deposit, 2=Withdrawal, 3=TransferOut, 4=TransferIn
